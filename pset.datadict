This is the data dictionary for pset.txt.

pset.txt is available to help you select from valid set of pinyin sounds for speech synthesis with the user-req-txt (user request) input text file.

There are two fields:
  - Field 1: zero-based index
  - Field 2: hanyu pinyin tone, a toned phoneme (toneme)

There are 2050 rows, 410 phonemes, each with 5 tones.

USING PSET TO CONFIG USER-REQ-TXT

To protect users, there is a rate-limiting on the Google Cloud TTS API. So, it is best to go slow and convert subsets of pset.

In Linux you can simply obtain the second field with this command:

```
$ cat pset.txt | cut -d' ' -f2
```

You can select the first 50 lines for user.req.txt:
```
$ cat pset.txt | cut -d' ' -f2 | head -n50 > user.req.txt
```


You can select the next 50 lines for user.req.txt:
```
$ cat pset.txt | cut -d' ' -f2 | head -n100 | tail -n50 > user.req.txt
```


You can select only umlaut-u pinyin for user.req.txt:
```
$ cat pset.txt | cut -d' ' -f2 | grep Ã¼ > user.req.txt
```
